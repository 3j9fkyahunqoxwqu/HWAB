# HWAB
Harden Windows AND Browser (short: HWAB) is designed to explain and keep an eyes on the security aspect

 
Since a lot of people asking me how to secure/harden Windows and Browser to lower the secuity risk and attack factor I created this little repo to answer the most questions and show examples in easy step by step examples.


This is currently under constuction, so nothing much to show here. But I will upload and maintain this project regulary as I have time.
