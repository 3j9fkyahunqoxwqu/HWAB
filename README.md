# HWAB
Harden Windows AND Browser (short: HWAB) is designed to explain and keep an eyes on the security aspect.

 
Since a lot of people asking me how to secure/harden Windows and Browser to lower the security risk and attack factor I created this little repo to answer the most questions and show examples in easy step by step examples.


This is currently under construction, so nothing much to show here. But I will upload and maintain this project regularly as I have time.


Guide focus:
* Brute force attack(s)
* Dictionary Hacking(s)
* Phishing attack(s)
* Spidering attack(s)
* Keylogger attack(s)
* Ransomware attack(s)
* Audit(s)


Software focus:
* [Sanboxie](https://www.sandboxie.com)
* [Chromium](http://chromium.woolyss.com) ~or Ungoogled Chromium~
* [DNSCrypt](https://dnscrypt.org) or [Simple DNSCrypt](https://simplednscrypt.org/)
* [Unbound](http://unbound.net/) (used as cache)
* [RamDisk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdisk-toolkit/) (optional)


OS Focus:
* Windows 


Main questions will be answered like - are you safe if:
* You aren’t regularly deploying the latest security patches?
* You disabled a security feature after a user complained Facebook was slower?
* You have unprotected mobile devices that can connect to file shares?
* Your email doesn’t get scanned for viruses and spam?
* Visitors can access your Wi-Fi, which is on the same network as your servers?
* Anyone is allowed to turn on macros in Office documents they receive via email?
* Users can read files they shouldn’t access at all and write to files they shouldn’t change?
* You don’t require users to choose suitable passwords?
* You ignore alerts from your security software that are warning you something is wrong?
* You’ve forgotten about those old XP machines still running in the basement?
